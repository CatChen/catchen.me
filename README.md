# catchen.me

This is the source code that can be compiled into the static site behind catchen.me.

## Compile

To compile the source code into static site pages, we need to use [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp).

Install Harp with `npm install -g harp`. Compile with `harp compile`. Develop with `harp server` on localhost.
