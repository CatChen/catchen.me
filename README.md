# catchen.me [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d31fdc8f-877d-4986-911e-41cd7804bb09/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/catchen/deploys)

This is the source code that can be compiled into the static site behind catchen.me.

## Compile

To compile the source code into static site pages, we need to use [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp).

Install Harp with `npm install -g harp`. Compile with `harp compile`. Develop with `harp server` on localhost.
