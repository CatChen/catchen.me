This is the source code that can be compiled into the static site behind [catchen.me](https://catchen.me).

## Compile

To compile the source code into static site pages, we need to use [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp).

Install Harp and other dependencies with `npm install`. Compile with `npm run build`. Develop with `npm run start` on localhost.
